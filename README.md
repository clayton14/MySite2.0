### Where is version 1.0
In short I was writing my old website in raw html, css an js and this process was taking too log for me so I switched to using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to speed up the process. If you want to see the old site (you don't) you can view the archived repo [here](https://github.com/clayton14/MySite). I was spending too much time making stylizing my site rather then making  content.
