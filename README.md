### Where is version 1.0?
In short, I was writing my old website in raw HTML, CSS an JS. This process was taking too long, so I switched to using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to speed up the process. If you want to see the old site (you don't), then you can view the archived repo [here](https://github.com/clayton14/MySite).
