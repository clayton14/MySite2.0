## Where is version 1.0
In short I was writing my old website in raw html, css an js. This process was taking to log for me so I switched to using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to speed up the process. If you want to see the old site (you don't) you can view the repo [here](https://github.com/clayton14/MySite).
