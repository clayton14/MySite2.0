I am a hobbyist interested in a plethora of things including but not limited to, programming, photography, electronics, art, welding, robots, and machine learning. As time progresses this list might change because at the time of writing I am still in highschool and still don’t know what to do with my life. For those who managed to stumble on this small corner of the intent I hope you find this site of some use and enjoyment.\nWhy start a blog ? Why did I decide to start a blog? Well, for a couple of reasons.\nI feel like I always have dozens of projects that I have yet to complete, and maybe this will help hold me accountable for them. Hopefully you get some use out of them too.\nThis is my domain! Here I can post and talk about whatever I want without “Big Tech” deciding what is right or wrong. Secondly, most big tech companies are using you for-profit. You Won’t see any ads or analytics here, I would like to keep things Open.\nPodcasts? Not sure if I will do this but maybe I will add podcasts in the future so stay tuned.\nHow am I managing my site ? Recently I found a pretty cool static site generator known as Hugo. What is a static site generator? In order to answer that question first you need to know the difference between a static and a dynamic site. A dynamic site it’s something like Instagram where the user gets to interact with different elements on the site (eg. liking a post ). Likewise a static page is a website where only the administrator can make changes to it (Me) Every time you open the website it will be exactly the same unless I change it.\nNow that we have that out of the way, what is a static site generator? A static site generator is a piece of software that lets you use templates to generate full static HTML code. In my case all I have to do is put the content in a markdown file and Hugo does all the heavy lifting for me. I Won’t go down the Hugo rabbit hole in this post but maybe I will make a tutorial on it in the future.\nThe theme I am using is under the MIT license and was developed by Aditya Telange\n",
