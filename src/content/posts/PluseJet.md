# Making a Valveless pulsejet


Hello Haven't posted in a while and have been a bit busy with school.  I have decided to update you with one of my long and difficult projects. A project that might as well kill me if I am not careful enough. Yes, you read the title correctly, I am attempting to build a Valveless pulsejet. I have been working on this project for almost two years! At this point I can't remember my exact motivations for wanting to make a jet engine. When people ask me what I want to make a jet engine I respond with, “Why wouldn't you want to make a jet engine”


## What is a Valveless Pulse Jet? 


In order to understand what a Valveless pulse jet is you first need to understand what a [pulse jet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsejet) is and how that may differ from a [valveless pulsejet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valveless_pulsejet). Now I am no expert in this field, so my understanding of a pulse jet is limited to things I found online. In a nutshell a **valveless pulsejet** is a combustion engine that is capable of running with **no moving parts**. It gets its thrust from an oscillating explosion that occurs throughout the entire pipe.The jet that I have been building is based on the [Lockwood-Hiller Design](https://patents.google.com/patent/US3462955A/en), which is basically a large deformed piece of metallic macaroni. I have referenced a decent amount of information on [Bruce Simpson blog](https://aardvark.co.nz/pjet/valveless.htm) about Valveless pulse jets. Feel free to read it if you want more information on the topic. The size of the jet is not that much of an issue, I have seen people make much smaller ones that are mounted onto RC planes and even some made out of soup cans.  ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/k-vN96m5OSdlZSlRDgffae2PTRt89gdCezfjFhxF8WH9XqaQUFkGuDvz1M4vCdsrJHomjzyor8VmbB5XwXJb7mBMc9XRuekJ05zDKP4YDzGIJgEo9PZ08lISZIFGf55V49TulRvvobu2T6NeOKPLHRc)


## Who In Their Right Mind Would Do This?   


Only crazy people of course, and I happen to fall into that bucket. I have spent little over a year just honing in the skill to weld together the body of the engine. I don't really know why I felt the need to do this? But I did. That being said If you decide to use this site as instructions and obliterate yourself into a million tiny pieces, don't make me responsible. This is a risk I am taking for your entertainment. 


## Planning and Designing 


As of now I only have designs for the main body of the engine. I have yet to consider and design a fuel system that has all the necessary safety measures in place. Look, I get it, I walked into this. I know that building a jet engine is probably not the safest thing I could do with my _free time_. I still don't want this thing to become a bomb, so I will create a separate post on how I set up the fuel system (once I figure that out).  I have linked other websites where you can find blueprints but I will include the ones I made here. They aren't very pretty but planning things out is always a good step to take. &lt;add pictures here> ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/L-PBSNIeUgwaNbmSBlC88lvfFvFXmJE410Ki2U8RBNsxfN3ib4H7GYHcm4Uk2VPrNsreFCGxr4dl4KvaQQxuJDJXLI94_bbUgu5AeqUJJF3tp9YZ3Q8aqnC88J2EDKTMqhUxBt3RNejSZT-M1OVinZQ)My crappy blueprints I made on isometric graph paper. 

The next thing to do is obtaining the parts and making sure you have all the necessary tools and skill to assemble the engine. Rember, the idea behind a valveless pulse jet is that it has no moving parts, thus making the manufacturing process more simple. This project required me to weld all the pisces together so I would need all the appropriate [welding PPE](https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/safety_haz/welding/ppe.html)  such as:
- Helmet
- Gloves 
- Steel toe shoes

Explain necessary parts

The next step would be obtaining all the parts if you want to base it off of my design you can view the &lt;BOM here>. Another important step is making sure you have all the necessary tools to assemble the engine. Luckily for me I am enrolled in a technical school where they offer welding as a class. This way I could use their tools to work on this project. I have almost all the tools required at home. The only thing I was missing was a slip roll forming machine I used to make the exhaust cone.Here is my minimum number of tools required to assemble the frame:- TIG welder (better control on thin metals)
- slip roll forming machine
- Level 
- Tape measure
- Angle grinder
- Belt grinder
- Variety of clamps**


## Welding and Assembly


Here is the part you have all been waiting for, assembly.  I wanted to start off with assembling the combustion chamber. I slipped each reducer into either side of the combustion chamber and used 3/16 filler rod wire as a spacer and to make sure it was centered. After making sure everything was level and centered I tack welded the two together. When tack welding the reducer the the combustion chamber makes sure **the tack welds are directly across from one another**. This is very important, otherwise when you go to weld the two together one side will pull on the other making the reducer crooked.
