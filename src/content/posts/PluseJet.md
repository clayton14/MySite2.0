# Making a Valveless pulsejet

Hello 

Haven't posted in a while and have been a bit busy with school.  I have decided to update you with one of my long and difficult projects. A project that might as well kill me if I am not careful enough. Yes, you read the title correctly, I am attempting to build a Valveless pulsejet. 


## Who In Their Right Mind Would do This?   

Only crazy people of course, and I happen to fall into that bucket. I have spent little over a year just honing in the skill to weld together the body of the engine. I don't really know why I felt the need to do this? But I did. 

That being said If you decide to use this site as instructions and obliterate yourself into a million tiny pieces, don't make me responsible. This is a risk I am taking for your entertainment.  


## What is a Valveless Pulse Jet? 

In order to understand what a Valveless pulse jet is you first need to understand what a [pulse jet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsejet) is. Now I am no expert in this field, so my understanding of a pulse jet is limited to things I found online. In a nutshell a **pulsejet** is a combustion engine that is capable of running with **no moving parts**. 

The jet that I have been building is based on the [Lockwood-Hiller Design](https://patents.google.com/patent/US3462955A/en). I have referenced a decent amount of information on [Bruce Simpson blog](https://aardvark.co.nz/pjet/valveless.htm) about Valveless pulse jets. 


## Planning and Designing 

As of now I only have designs for the main body of the engine. I have yet to consider and design a fuel system that has all the necessary safety measures in place. Look, I get it, I walked into this. I know that building a jet engine is probably not the safest thing I could do with my free time. But I still don't want this thing to become a bomb, so I will create a separate post on how I set up the file system. 

I have linked other websites where you can find blueprints but I will include the ones I made here. They aren't very pretty but planning things out is always a good step to take.

The next thing to do is obtaining the parts and making sure you have all the necessary tools and skill to assemble the engine. Rember, the idea behind a valveless pulse jet is that it has no moving parts, thus making the manufacturing process more simple.
