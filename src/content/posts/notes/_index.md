 As I, and many other engineers, dive into their projects, bugs and other mishaps will inevitably come up.  Whether it's related to software or hardware, I would like to dedicate this page to the small issues I have encountered and how I went about resolving them. 

You might find answers to your questions here, or at least a useful hint in the right direction.
