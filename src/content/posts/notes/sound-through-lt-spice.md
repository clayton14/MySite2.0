Wheather your a student, proffisional, or hobbiest, you will eventually come across [SPICE Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPICE) when desigining electronics projects. SPICE software, such as [LTspice](https://www.analog.com/en/resources/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html), can be used to simulate your analog and digital designs without having to bust out a breadboard or soldering iron.

One feature I have found incredibly usefull when desiging analog audio circuits like <link to guitar pedel project> is LTspices ability to process `.wav` files as a voltage input.
