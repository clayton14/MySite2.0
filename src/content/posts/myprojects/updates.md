## Its been a wile

It's been three years in the making.
The last time I have put any content on this website was back when I was in highschool. I have been wanting to update things, write posts, and add new features but sometimes life gets in the way of these things. Now that I have more time on my hands I thought that my website needed some attention.

I am in the works of changing how the backend of my site works as well as changing some things I don't like about the current theme I am using. Until then stay posted.

### Remark42
[Remark 42](https://remark42.com/) is a lightweight open source committing engine that I can embed into different posts. This can allow people to leave feedback and discuss whatever project I am currently working on. It also gives people the option to correct me, which I encourage,  without having to use git and or leave a pull request. 

After I take care of some backend maintenance I hope to add remark 42 to my site.
