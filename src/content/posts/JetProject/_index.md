Haven't posted in a while and have been a bit busy with school.  I have decided to update you with one of my long and difficult projects. A project that might as well kill me if I am not careful enough. Yes, you read the title correctly, I am attempting to build a Valveless pulsejet. I have been working on this project for almost two years! Due to school and work finding the time to put this article together and post it took a significant amount of time, and well… and courage if i'm being honest.

At this point I can't remember my exact motivations for wanting to make a jet engine. When people ask me what I want to make a jet engine I respond with, “Why wouldn't you want to make a jet engine”

Unfortunately this project will have to come to an end. When I was taking welding in high school it was a great project that allowed me to learn both metal fabrication and pipe welding.
