## Who is Clayton Easley ? 
Hi my name is clayton. I am a hobbyist interested in a plethora of things including but not limited to, programming, photography, electronics, art, welding,  robots, and machine learning. As time progresses this list might change because at the time of writing I am still in highschool and still don't know what to do with my life. For those who managed to stumble on this small corner of the intent I hope you find this site of some use and enjoyment. 

### Why start a blog ?

Why did I decide to start a blog? Well, for a couple of reasons.
1. I feel like I always have dozens of projects that I have yet to complete, and maybe this will help hold me accountable for them. Hopefully you get some use out of them too.

2. This is my domain! Here I can post and talk about whatever I want without “Big Tech” deciding what is right or wrong. Secondly, most big tech companies are **using you**  for-profit. You Won't see any ads or analytics here, I would like to keep things Open Source. 
   
3. Podcasts? Not sure if I will do this but maybe I will add podcasts in the future so stay tuned.


### How am I managing my site ?

Recently I found a pretty cool static site generator known as [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). What is a static site generator? In order to answer that question first you need to know the difference between a static and a dynamic site.  A dynamic site it's something like Instagram where the user gets to interact with different elements on the site (eg. liking a post ). Likewise a static page is  a website where only the administrator can make changes to it (Me) Every time you open the website it will be exactly the same unless I change it. 

Now that we have that out of the way, what is a static site generator? A static site generator is a piece of software that lets you use templates to generate full static HTML code. In my case all I have to do is put the content in a markdown file and Hugo does all the heavy lifting for me. I Won't go down the Hugo rabbit hole in this post  but maybe I will make a tutorial on it in the future.
